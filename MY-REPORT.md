# Research Question 
Exploring how cutting-edge AI prompting techniques can power a next-gen nutrition and fitness bot for smarter, personalized health guidance!

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

AI-driven nutrition and fitness bots already leverage machine learning and rule-based algorithms to provide personalized health recommendations. Techniques like **Chain of Thought (COT), Tree of Thoughts (TOT), and Few-Shot Prompting** have been successfully applied in other domains (e.g., medical diagnosis, decision-making systems) to improve reasoning, personalization, and adaptability. Existing fitness apps use calorie tracking, workout suggestions, and general health insights, but **few truly break down reasoning step-by-step or explore multiple pathways dynamically**. Integrating **advanced prompting strategies** can make recommendations **more interactive, context-aware, and personalized** than ever before!
